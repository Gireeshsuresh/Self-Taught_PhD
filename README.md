# Self Taught PhD - A Journey to quench my thirst of Knowledge | Gireesh Suresh

### Why am I doing a **PhD**, that is *Self-taught* ?
 
 In the words of *Albert Einstein* :
> “Any fool can know. The point is to understand.”
					

Doctor of Philosophy(PhD), as per `Wikipedia` “ are usually required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge, normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation, and defend their work against experts in the field ”. 

My drive to do a PhD (rather Self Taught PhD) is mainly to expand my technical knowledge base where in I could study things I didnt know [ (or) rather needed to brush up certian things...] and to further hone my skillset. I believe in Applied Research more so than theoritical approach, primarily because of the personal satisfaction you get on seeing things work in real than on paper. Unlike some people, my intentions are to attain the proper etiquette associated wuth the usage of the subject and the professional ethics of the scholarly society rather than having a "Dr." as title and a certificate to back that.[That's just my thought]. Hence the Self-Taught PhD. 
Afterall who else can be a better person to judge/please,  if not your own self ??

The Aim, moving forward is to put myself into a rigorous schedule/timeline within which I would like to understand and make meaningful use (through projects) of my learnings and further deepen my focus on the subject of Robotics.For the critic's reading this, Yes, I am not like a conventional PhD candidate, but once I am done with this, Knowledge expectation is to be on par with them. 

"Thesis Defense" equivalent here might be to publish my work in Conferences, Journals and maybe take advice from the Opensource community and Scholars out in thre wide world, and what is best possible from a student who is not attending a University in a professional setting.

### ABSTRACT

Automatic Parking is an autonomous car maneuvering system that moves a vehicle from a traffic lane into a parking spot to perform parallel parking. The automatic parking system aims to enhance the comfort and safety of driving in constrained environments where much attention and experience is required to steer the car. The parking maneuver is achieved by means of coordinated control of the steering angle and speed which considers the actual situation i.e., the free spaces and the obstacle spaces in the environment to ensure collision-free motion within the available space. The path shape required for a parking maneuver is evaluated from the environmental model, generating a fifth-order polynomial, the corresponding control commands are selected and parameterized to provide motion within the available space. In real-time application, the commands are executed by the car servo-systems which drive the vehicle into the parking place.
