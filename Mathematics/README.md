Knowing the mathematics behind machine learning algorithms is a superpower. 

If you have ever built a model for a real-life problem, you probably experienced that being familiar with the details can go a long way if you want to move beyond baseline performance. 
This is especially true when you want to push the boundaries of state of the art.
